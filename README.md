[tinybitcoinpeer.py](/tinybitcoinpeer.py)
==================

A toy bitcoin peer in Python. Connects to a random testnet 
node, shakes hands, reacts to pings, and asks for pongs. 
This file is intended to be useful as a starting point for 
building your own Bitcoin network tools. Rather than doing 
things one way, it illustrates several alternatives... 
feel free to pick and choose.
